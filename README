Driver for Dragon Rise SNES USB controller
You should probably set the global variable OBJMAKEDIR to a new directory within the source folder.

setenv OBJMAKEDIR /some/directory

#make

#kldload /some/directory/joy.ko

Once you plug in the gamepad you should be able to use it with the emulator of your choice. I've only tested it with ZSNES and Snes9x.
