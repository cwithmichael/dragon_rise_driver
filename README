You should probably set the global variable MAKEOBJDIR to a new directory within the source folder.

#env MAKEOBJDIR=/some/directory make


#kldload /some/directory/joy.ko

Once you plug in the gamepad you should be able to use it with the emulator of your choice. I've only tested it with ZSNES and Snes9x.
