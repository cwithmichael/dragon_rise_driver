Driver for Dragon Rise SNES USB controller

From revision 333633 this driver is now part of FreeBSD base.  
https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=333633

The device will show up as /dev/uhid_snes when plugged in.

You should probably set the global variable MAKEOBJDIR to a new directory within the source folder.

#env MAKEOBJDIR=/some/directory make


#kldload /some/directory/joy.ko

Once you plug in the gamepad you should be able to use it with the emulator of your choice. I've only tested it with ZSNES.

Doesn't work with Snes9x at the moment. 
It recognizes the device but that's about it.
